Jake and Snoop - an adorable, if oddly matched, pair of sweet pups. We had the pleasure of watching these guys for ~2 weeks in their goreous Mendham, NJ home in what we belive to have been our first actual pet sitting gig, as a couple, back in 2008.

Jake is the large, blockhead golden retrieiver - the muscle of the pair.  For Jake, life is ball, and ball is life. As with most goldens he was full of energy and love.

Snoop is the basset hound - the brains of the operation. He was quite advanced in age but still got around well, and his favorite activity was to walk the well-trodden path up and around the small hill in the backyard. If you didn't open his can of wet food fast enough, he'd let you know with the trademark hound howl.
