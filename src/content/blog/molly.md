<p>
    Molly - a corgi mix who looked like a miniature golden retriever. I meanâ€¦ could she be any cuter?
</p>

<p>
    We watched Molly in our Princeton, NJ apartment for 1 week while her parents were on vacation. 
</p>

    Molly was super chill and a breeze to take care of. She loved long walks around campus and was never one to turn down a biscuit. A true people lover, Molly was well-known in the neighborhood and would happily solicit pets from anyone who offered them.

    After a long day, she preferred to curl up at night at the end of our bed to sleep. We were always happy for the evening and morning snuggles with this cutie.
