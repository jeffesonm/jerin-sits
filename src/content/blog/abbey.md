<p>
    Abbey - an incredibly regal-looking Siberian cat. Look at her. Is she not a queen? 
</p>

<p>
    On several different occasions we had the pleasure of looking after Abbey in her beautiful home perched atop the Santa Cruz mountains of California. 
</p>

<p>
    An indoor-outdoor cat, Abbey was equally happy lounging at the top of her cat tree and taking in the sweeping mountain views, as she was exploring the hillside or sunning herself on the back deck.
</p>

<p>
    While not the most snuggly cat, Abbey was pleased to know you understood how lovely she was. Sheâ€™d occasionally allow pets, but never when she was in her cat tree, gazing down upon her domain. Up there, she preferred to be left alone. Like the queen she is.
