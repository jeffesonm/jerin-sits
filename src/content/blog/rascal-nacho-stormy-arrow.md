    Rascal, Nacho, Stormy, and Arrow - We watched this motley crew for 8 days at their lovely home in Annapolis, MD. 

<p>
    Rascal, a French bull dog, is sweet as she is strange looking.  Earlier in the day she'd work out her spastic energy zooming around the house, periodically antagonizing her housemates.  By late afternoon she'd wind down and for the remainder of the day was quite content to lay across your legs, lounging in front of the TV. 
</p>

<p>
    Nacho, a mutt rescued from a highway median, is about the sweetest, chillest dog you will meet. He would also love to sit on your lap, if you’d let him, but he usually made do with his head in your lap or curled up on the floor next to the couch. 
</p>

<p>
    Nacho and Rascal were the perfect pair. They loved to wrestle and chase one another around the yard, and were always eager to talk a long walk around the neighborhood together.

    Stormy, the friendliest long-haired black cat, was a serious snuggler. She spent most of her days in the finished basement, emerging from hiding as soon as we came downstairs to our bedroom suite. She was always eager for pets though her exciement would often bubble over into aggressive bitey time. She spent the nights curled up at the foot of our bed.

    Arrow, Stormy’s brother, was the more adventurous of the pair. An indoor-outdoor cat, Arrow preferred to spend his time outside, sprawled out in the afternoon sun on the front porch and then slinking about the bushes at night. Arrow would come in a few times a day for food, treats, and pets before heading back aside to explore his domain. While Stormy preferred to avoid Nacho and Rascal, Arrow was never afraid to remind those two who the real boss was.

    We had a blast watching this crew and enjoyed getting to know each of their unique personalities and quirks.
