<p>
    Finneas - an adorable kitty whose coloring reminded us vaguely of a creamsicle. We watched Finneas for a week at his home in Red Bank, NJ. 
</p>

<p>
    An indoor-outdoor cat, Finneas loved to be outside whenever he could. You could find him stalking bugs in the back yard or lounging on the screened in porch. 
</p>

<p>
    An independent cat, Finneas was happy to do his own thing, although heâ€™d usually find a way to be nearby - just close enough to know you were there.

    Finneas was also part retriever and enjoyed playing fetch in the living room with his little stuffed mouse.  More than anything, he loved cat treats, and we were happy to oblige.
