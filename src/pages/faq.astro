        title="What services do you offer? Dog walking? Boarding? Sitting?"
    >
        <p>At this time we only offer pet sitting, in your home.</p>
        <p>Of course if your pet is a dog, we look forward to walking them while you're gone. Also happy to bring in the mail, water the plants, burp your kimchi, and probably just about anything  </p>

    <AccordionItem
        name="howmuchdoyoucharge"
        title="How much do you charge for pet sitting?"
    >
        <p>It depends on the pet/house situation, time of year, our schedules, etc, but in general we shoot for "a little less than the going rate".</p>

    <AccordionItem
        name="areyouresponsible"
        title="Are you responsible? Can I entrust you with Fluffy, Spot and my house?"
    >
        <p>We are about as responsible as you can get, without being completly boring. We're both in our early forties and between the two of us, our average credit score is ~835. We've been pet owners/lovers our entire lives, and home owners for the past 13+ years.</p>
        <p>Jeff is also an accomplished handyman (like once built a house) so it's likely that if anything comes up, he can at least triage it, and maybe just get it sorted. </p>

    <AccordionItem
        name="howdoigetintouch"
        title="How do I get in touch with you?"
    >
        <p>The internet strongly recommended we don't directly post our contact info, so kindly request you inquire via <a href="https://forms.gle/znvkBdMJNMRyrGaf6" target="_new">this Google form</a> and we'll reach out asap.</p>
